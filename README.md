# Fantasy Sword Duels

Think *magic* infused, *sword duel* themed, RPG version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, 
where you progress through levels, manage attribute points, and develop combat strategies. 
The combat resolution logic takes multiple variables into account, such as action type, 
player attributes, and chances of unique scenarios being activated.
Information about each play-through is stored in a database.

**Technologies**: Java, Spring framework, PostgreSQL

**Future goal(s)**: 
Create a *front end* to:
 - play the game online
 - display a scoreboard

**Future fantasies**:
 - *difficulty levels* - perhaps enemies learning from player actions (**machine learning**)
 - *compare combat strategies* across players of the game (**data analysis**)
